There, I was exposed to the processes of launching major international brands. I was fascinated by the opportunities in the technology field, especially when developing an internal project, where I realized the need for a more technological approach in the internal processes of large companies.

2. **Banking Institution**: In my first internship, I worked at a banking institution, where I had the chance to be involved in account opening and meticulous document analysis, essential activities for credit analysis.
